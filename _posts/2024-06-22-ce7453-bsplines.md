# B-splines

B-splines (Basis splines) represent a powerful mathematical tool for curve and surface representation in computer graphics, CAD systems, and geometric modeling. This post provides a comprehensive overview of B-splines, including their mathematical foundations, key properties, algorithms for evaluation and manipulation, and practical applications.

## Historical Context

B-splines evolved from the need to overcome limitations of Bezier curves:

- **1946**: Schoenberg introduces the concept of B-splines in approximation theory
- **1960s**: Development of the recursive definition by de Boor, Cox, and Mansfield
- **1970s**: Integration into CAD/CAM systems
- **1980s**: Development of NURBS (Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines)
- **Current**: Industry standard for curve and surface representation

## Key Concepts

### 1. B-spline Basis Functions

B-spline basis functions $N_{i,p}(t)$ are defined recursively:

**Degree 0 (constant):**
$$N_{i,0}(t) = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } t_i \leq t < t_{i+1} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

**Higher degrees:**
$$N_{i,p}(t) = \frac{t - t_i}{t_{i+p} - t_i} N_{i,p-1}(t) + \frac{t_{i+p+1} - t}{t_{i+p+1} - t_{i+1}} N_{i+1,p-1}(t)$$

where:
- $t$ is the parameter value
- $t_i$ are knot values from the knot vector
- $p$ is the degree of the basis function

#### Properties of Basis Functions

1. **Local Support**: Each $N_{i,p}(t)$ is non-zero only in the interval $[t_i, t_{i+p+1}]$
2. **Partition of Unity**: At any parameter value $t$, $\sum_{i=0}^{n} N_{i,p}(t) = 1$
3. **Non-negativity**: $N_{i,p}(t) \geq 0$ for all $i$, $p$, and $t$
4. **Continuity**: $C^{p-k}$ continuity at a knot with multiplicity $k$

### 2. Knot Vectors

A knot vector $T = \{t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_m\}$ is a non-decreasing sequence of parameter values:

- **Uniform**: Knots are equally spaced
- **Open (clamped)**: First and last knots have multiplicity $p+1$
- **Non-uniform**: Unequal spacing between knots

#### Knot Vector Formulation

For a B-spline of degree $p$ with $n+1$ control points, the knot vector has $m+1$ knots where $m = n+p+1$.

**Examples:**
- Uniform: $T = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$
- Open uniform: $T = \{0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3\}$ (cubic with multiplicity 3 at endpoints)
- Non-uniform: $T = \{0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3\}$ (multiplicity 2 at interior knot $t=2$)

#### Effect of Knot Multiplicity

- **Single knot**: $C^{p-1}$ continuity at that knot
- **Double knot**: $C^{p-2}$ continuity
- **Multiplicity $k$**: $C^{p-k}$ continuity
- **Multiplicity $p$**: $C^0$ continuity (curve passes through control point)
- **Multiplicity $p+1$**: Discontinuity at that knot

### 3. B-spline Curves

A B-spline curve is defined as:

$$P(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} P_i N_{i,p}(t)$$

where:
- $P_i$ are the control points
- $N_{i,p}(t)$ are the B-spline basis functions of degree $p$
- $t$ is the parameter value within the domain $[t_p, t_{n+1}]$

#### Properties of B-spline Curves

1. **Local Control**: Moving a control point affects only the curve segment within $p+1$ spans
2. **Convex Hull**: Curve lies within the convex hull of $p+1$ consecutive control points
3. **Variation Diminishing**: Curve doesn't oscillate more than its control polygon
4. **Affine Invariance**: Affine transformations can be applied to control points
5. **Endpoint Interpolation**: With an open knot vector, the curve passes through first and last control points

### 4. Evaluation Algorithms

#### Finding the Knot Span

```python
def find_span(t, knots):
    """

    # Special cases
    if t >= knots[n]:
        return n - 1
    if t <= knots[0]:
        return 0
    
    # Binary search
    low = 0
    high = n
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    
    while t < knots[mid] or t >= knots[mid+1]:
        if t < knots[mid]:
            high = mid

        for r in range(j):
            # Avoid division by zero
            if right[r + 1] + left[j - r] == 0.0:
                temp = 0.0
            else:
                temp = N[r] / (right[r + 1] + left[j - r])
            
            N[r] = saved + right[r + 1] * temp
            saved = left[j - r] * temp

    return d[degree]
```

### 2. Knot Insertion

- **Purpose**: Add knots without changing curve shape
- **Applications**: 
  - Refinement for analysis
  - Splitting curves
  - Converting to Bezier representation

#### Knot Insertion Algorithm

To insert a knot t̄ into knot vector T (between t<sub>k</sub> and t<sub>k+1</sub>):

1. New knot vector: T' = {t₀, t₁, ..., t<sub>k</sub>, t̄, t<sub>k+1</sub>, ..., t<sub>m</sub>}
2. New control points:
   P<sub>i</sub>' = αᵢP<sub>i</sub> + (1-αᵢ)P<sub>i-1</sub> for i = k-p+1, ..., k
   where:
   - αᵢ = (t̄ - t<sub>i</sub>)/(t<sub>i+p</sub> - t<sub>i</sub>) if i ∈ [k-p+1, k]
   - αᵢ = 1 if i > k
   - αᵢ = 0 if i < k-p+1
3. Original control points outside the range [k-p+1, k] remain unchanged

```python
def knot_insertion(t_bar, control_points, knots, degree):
    """
    Insert a knot into a B-spline curve without changing its shape.
    
    Parameters:
    - t_bar: Parameter value of new knot
    - control_points: Original control points
    - knots: Original knot vector
    - degree: Degree of the B-spline
    
    Returns:
    - New control points
    - New knot vector
    """
    import numpy as np
    
    n = len(control_points) - 1
    
    # Find knot span containing t_bar
    k = find_span(t_bar, knots)
    
    # Create new knot vector
    new_knots = knots.copy()
    new_knots.insert(k + 1, t_bar)
    
    # Create new control points array
    new_control_points = [None] * (n + 2)
    
    # Copy unaffected control points
    for i in range(k - degree + 1):
        new_control_points[i] = control_points[i]
    
    for i in range(k + 1, n + 1):
        new_control_points[i + 1] = control_points[i]
    
    # Calculate affected control points
    for i in range(k - degree + 1, k + 1):
        # Calculate alpha
        if i <= k - degree:
            alpha = 0.0
        elif i >= k + 1:
            alpha = 1.0
        else:
            alpha = (t_bar - knots[i]) / (knots[i + degree] - knots[i])
        
        # Calculate new control point
        new_control_points[i] = (1 - alpha) * control_points[i - 1] + alpha * control_points[i]
    
    return new_control_points, new_knots
```

#### Bezier Decomposition

By inserting knots of multiplicity p at each interior knot, a B-spline can be converted into a series of Bezier curves. This is useful for rendering and intersection algorithms.

```python
def bezier_decomposition(control_points, knots, degree):
    """
    Decompose a B-spline curve into a series of Bezier curves.
    
    Parameters:
    - control_points: B-spline control points
    - knots: B-spline knot vector
    - degree: Degree of the B-spline
    
    Returns:
    - List of Bezier control point sets
    """
    # Create deep copies to avoid modifying originals
    cp = control_points.copy()
    kv = knots.copy()
    
    # Get unique internal knots
    unique_internal_knots = []
    for k in kv[degree:-degree]:
        if k not in unique_internal_knots:
            unique_internal_knots.append(k)
    
    # Insert knots to get Bezier segments
    for knot in unique_internal_knots:
        # Determine current multiplicity
        mult = kv.count(knot)
        # Insert knot until multiplicity reaches degree
        for _ in range(degree - mult):
            cp, kv = knot_insertion(knot, cp, kv, degree)
    
    # Extract Bezier segments
    bezier_segments = []
    segment_size = degree + 1
    
    # For each segment
    for i in range(len(cp) - degree):
        if i % degree == 0:
            segment = cp[i:i+segment_size]
            if len(segment) == segment_size:
                bezier_segments.append(segment)
    
    return bezier_segments
```

### 3. Degree Elevation

- **Process**: Increase degree while preserving shape
- **Application**: Compatibility between curves of different degrees

#### Degree Elevation Algorithm

To increase the degree of a B-spline from p to p+1:

1. Create a new knot vector by adding duplicates of each knot
2. Calculate new control points through a linear combination of original points
3. Preserve the shape of the original curve

```python
def degree_elevate(control_points, knots, degree):
    """
    Elevate the degree of a B-spline curve by 1.
    
    Parameters:
    - control_points: Original control points
    - knots: Original knot vector
    - degree: Original degree
    
    Returns:
    - New control points
    - New knot vector
    """
    n = len(control_points) - 1
    m = len(knots) - 1
    
    # New dimensions
    new_n = n + (n + 1)  # (n+1) new points
    new_degree = degree + 1
    new_m = m + 2  # 2 new knots
    
    # Create new knot vector
    new_knots = [0] * (new_m + 1)
    
    # First degree+1 knots are same
    for i in range(degree + 1):
        new_knots[i] = knots[i]
    
    # Last degree+1 knots are same
    for i in range(1, degree + 2):
        new_knots[new_m - degree - 1 + i] = knots[m - degree + i]
    
    # Interior knots
    for i in range(1, m - 2 * degree):
        # For each original knot, insert it twice
        new_knots[degree + 2*i] = knots[degree + i]
        new_knots[degree + 2*i + 1] = knots[degree + i]
    
    # Calculate new control points
    new_control_points = [None] * (new_n + 1)
    
    # First and last control points remain unchanged
    new_control_points[0] = control_points[0]
    new_control_points[new_n] = control_points[n]
    
    # Calculate intermediate control points
    for i in range(1, n):
        alpha = i / (n + 1)
        new_control_points[2*i] = (1 - alpha) * control_points[i-1] + alpha * control_points[i]
        new_control_points[2*i+1] = (1 - alpha) * control_points[i] + alpha * control_points[i+1]
    
    return new_control_points, new_knots
```

### 4. Non-Uniform Rational B-splines (NURBS)

- **Definition**: Rational extension of B-splines
- **Equation**: P(t) = Σ<sub>i=0</sub><sup>n</sup> w<sub>i</sub>P<sub>i</sub> N<sub>i,k</sub>(t) / Σ<sub>i=0</sub><sup>n</sup> w<sub>i</sub> N<sub>i,k</sub>(t)
- **Advantages**:
  - Exact representation of conic sections
  - Perspective invariance
  - Extended modeling capabilities

#### NURBS Formulation

NURBS extend B-splines by associating a weight w<sub>i</sub> with each control point P<sub>i</sub>. The rational basis functions are:

R<sub>i,p</sub>(t) = w<sub>i</sub>N<sub>i,p</sub>(t) / Σ<sub>j=0</sub><sup>n</sup> w<sub>j</sub>N<sub>j,p</sub>(t)

The NURBS curve is then:
P(t) = Σ<sub>i=0</sub><sup>n</sup> P<sub>i</sub>R<sub>i,p</sub>(t)

#### Representing Conic Sections

NURBS can exactly represent circles, ellipses, and other conic sections:

**Circle**: With degree p=2, n+1=9 control points, and weights:
- P₀, P₂, P₄, P₆, P₈ on the circle with w=1
- P₁, P₃, P₅, P₇ at intersections of tangent lines with w=cos(π/4) = 1/√2 ≈ 0.7071

```python
def create_circle_nurbs():
    """

### Isogeometric Analysis

This advanced technique unifies CAD and finite element analysis by using the same NURBS basis functions for both geometry representation and analysis, eliminating the need for geometry approximation through meshing.

```python
def calculate_isogeometric_basis(t, knots, degree, derivative=0):
    """
    Calculate NURBS basis functions for isogeometric analysis.
    
    Parameters:
    - t: Parameter value
    - knots: Knot vector
    - degree: Degree of basis functions
    - derivative: Order of derivative (0=function, 1=first derivative)
    
    Returns:
    - Array of basis function values or derivatives
    """
    # Basis function derivatives calculation
    # Implementation depends on specific IGA approach
    # This is a simplified example
    
    span = find_span(t, knots)
    
    if derivative == 0:
        # Just return the basis functions
        return basis_functions(span, degree, t, knots)
    else:
        # Calculate derivatives using finite differences
        # Real implementations would use analytical derivatives
        epsilon = 1e-6
        basis_at_t = basis_functions(span, degree, t, knots)
        basis_at_t_plus_e = basis_functions(span, degree, t + epsilon, knots)
        
        # First derivative approximation
        derivatives = [(b2 - b1) / epsilon for b1, b2 in zip(basis_at_t, basis_at_t_plus_e)]
        return derivatives
```

## Comparison with Bezier Curves

    """
    import numpy as np
    
    # Points to interpolate

        # For each parameter value, calculate basis functions
        param = params[i]
        span = find_span(param, knots)
        basis = basis_functions(span, degree, param, knots)
        
        # Fill row with basis function values

    # Set up right-hand side
    b = np.zeros((n, 2))
    b[1:n-1] = points[1:n-1]  # Interior points
    # End derivatives constraints remain zero
    
    # Solve the system
    control_points = np.linalg.solve(A, b)

## Beyond Basic B-splines: Advanced Topics

### 1. Tensor Product Surfaces

B-spline surfaces are formed using tensor products, with bidirectional control points and two knot vectors:

$$S(u,v) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \sum_{j=0}^{m} P_{i,j} N_{i,p}(u) N_{j,q}(v)$$

### 2. T-splines

T-splines extend NURBS by allowing T-junctions in the control mesh, enabling adaptive refinement without propagating control points.

### 3. Subdivision Surfaces

An alternative to NURBS that combines faceted modeling with smooth surface generation through recursive subdivision.

## Conclusion

B-splines provide a powerful and flexible framework for representing curves and surfaces in computer graphics and CAD. Their mathematical properties, efficient evaluation algorithms, and intuitive geometric interpretation make them an essential tool for geometric modeling. Understanding B-splines and their extensions (NURBS) is crucial for anyone working in computer graphics, CAD/CAM, animation, and related fields.
