## Exam Preparation Tips

When preparing for the CE7453 exam, consider the following strategies:

1. **Understand the fundamentals**: Focus on grasping the underlying principles rather than memorizing formulas.
2. **Practice implementation**: Try coding some of the algorithms to deepen your understanding.
3. **Connect related topics**: Many topics build upon each other (e.g., interpolation relates to B-splines).
4. **Work through examples**: Solve example problems from each topic.
5. **Review mathematical prerequisites**: Ensure your linear algebra and calculus foundations are solid.

## Additional Resources

All lecture notes are available in the course materials directory at `/files/CE7453/CE7453/`. Individual topic summaries have been created to help you focus your studies.
